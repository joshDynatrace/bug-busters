## Open the TODO App and add a Task

The TODO app has a duplicate function, let's give it a try.

- Add a Task that we want to duplicate, we add **Call the Bugbusters**
![Duplicate](img/todo_app_duplicate.png)

- Hover over the added Task and on the right you'll notice a **&** symbol. This should duplicate the task.
![Duplicate](img/todo_app_duplicate2.png)

What happened? 
We notice a new task was created, but instead of a duplicate we see a weird string, looks like an ID. 

Let's continue our Bug Hunting Quest!

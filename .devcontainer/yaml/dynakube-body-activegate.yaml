    # - metrics-ingest
    # - dynatrace-api
    #
    capabilities:
      - routing
      - kubernetes-monitoring

    # Optional: Sets how many ActiveGate pods are spawned by the StatefulSet
    # Defaults to "1"
    #
    # replicas: 1

    # Optional: Sets the image used to deploy ActiveGate instances
    # Defaults to the latest ActiveGate image on the tenant's registry
    # Example: "ENVIRONMENTID.live.dynatrace.com/linux/activegate:latest"
    #
    # image: ""

    # Optional: Sets the activation group for ActiveGate instances
    #
    # group: ""
    group: CLUSTERNAME

    # Optional: Defines a custom properties file providing either as a value or as a reference to a secret

    #   value: |
    #     [connectivity]
    #     networkZone=
    #   valueFrom: myCustomPropertiesConfigMap

    # Optional: Specifies resource settings for ActiveGate instances
    # Consumption of the ActiveGate heavily depends on the workload to monitor
    # The values should be adjusted according to the workload
    #
    resources:
      requests:
        cpu: 100m
        memory: 512Mi
      limits:
        cpu: 500m
        memory: 768Mi

    # Optional: Sets a node selector to control on which nodes the ActiveGate will be deployed.
    # For more information on node selectors, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/assign-pods-nodes/
    #
    # nodeSelector: {}

    # Optional: Specifies tolerations to include with the ActiveGate StatefulSet.
    # For more information on tolerations, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/taint-and-toleration/
    #
    # tolerations:
    # - effect: NoSchedule
    #   key: node-role.kubernetes.io/master
    #   operator: Exists

    # Optional: Defines labels added to ActiveGate pods
    # Can be used to structure workloads
    #
    # labels:
    #   custom: label

    # Optional: Adds additional environment variables to ActiveGate pods
    #
    # env: []

    # Optional: Specifies the name of a secret containing a TLS certificate, a TLS key and the TLS key's password to be used by ActiveGate instances
    # If unset, a self-signed certificate is used
    # The secret is expected to have the following key-value pairs
    # server.p12: TLS certificate and TLS key pair in pkcs12 format
    # password: passphrase to decrypt the TLS certificate and TLS key pair
    #
    # tlsSecretName: "my-tls-secret"

    # Optional: Sets the DNS Policy for ActiveGate pods
    # Defaults to "Default"
    # For more information on DNS policies, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dns-pod-service/#pod-s-dns-policy
    #
    # dnsPolicy: "Default"

    # Optional: Specifies the priority class to assign to the ActiveGate Pods
    # No class is set by default
    # For more information on priority classes, see https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/pod-priority-preemption/
    #
    # priorityClassName: priority-class

    # Optional: Adds additional annotations to the ActiveGate pods
    #
    # annotations:
    #   annotation-key: annotation-value

    # Optional: Adds TopologySpreadConstraints to the ActiveGate pods
